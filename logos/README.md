# Logos

This directory contains logo files for various projects.

Logos should be organized by project or brand name in subdirectories when appropriate.

## Naming Convention

- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names (e.g., `my-project-logo.png`)
- Include size dimensions or variants in the name when applicable (e.g., `logo-small.png`, `logo-dark.png`)
- Prefer vector formats (SVG) when possible, but provide PNG fallbacks

## Supported Formats

- SVG (preferred for scalability)
- PNG (for raster graphics)
- JPG (for photographs)
